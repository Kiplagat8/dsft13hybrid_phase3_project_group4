    "<span style='font-family:Georgia'>The telecommunications industry is one of the most competitive sectors worldwide, where customer retention plays a critical role in profitability and long-term sustainability. While acquiring new customers is costly, retaining existing ones is significantly more profitable (Propello, 2024).Globally, churn rates in telecom average around 31% annually, with mobile churn around 20%, highlighting the magnitude of the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Syria, the mobile telecom market is dominated by two key players: Syriatel and MTN-Syria. Syriatel, founded in 2000, currently holds about 71% of the market share and reported 20% revenue growth in 2019, equivalent to SYP 221bn (~US$242m) . Despite its dominance, Syriatel faces challenges from economic sanctions, instability, and increasing customer expectations for service quality, pricing, and personalization.\n",
    "(The Syria Report, 2020),For this reason, understanding what factors drive churn and how to reduce it is a key business priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn in this context refers to the proportion of customers who stop using Syriatel’s services, either by terminating contracts or switching to competitors. Understanding and reducing churn is crucial for Syriatel’s financial health and market leadership.</span>"

    "<span style='font-family:Georgia'>Syriatel is experiencing customer churn that directly threatens its revenues and market position. While it has historically maintained a strong market share, rising competition, service quality issues, evolving customer demands, and broader political-economic instability increase the likelihood of customer attrition. Without effective churn prediction and retention strategies, Syriatel risks losing valuable customers, resulting in revenue loss, reduced market share, and diminished competitiveness.</span>"
